# Animal Trivia
This game is built using HTML, CSS and JQuery.
Once the user presses start a multiple choice question will be displayed and a timer will begin. 
If the user answers correctly, a message alerting them they are correct will be displayed along with an image.
If the user answers incorrectly, a message alerts them of the correct and answer and displays an image.
If no answer is selected before the timer runs out, the correct answer with an image will be displayed.
After the image and answer have been shown, the game will automatically display the next question.
Once all questions and answers have been shown, the game will tell the user how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered. 
The user then has the option to start the game over.
